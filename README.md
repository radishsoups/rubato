# Rubato

## Overview

Spotify's Blend playlists let you share your favorite songs with your friends based on your and their music preferences. However, users cannot manually add or remove songs in these playlists, which defeats the purpose of a collaborative playlist and restricts the playlist's contents to what Spotify wants to add.

Rubato is a web app that allows users to create playlists and share music with others. Users can register and log in, and once they're logged in, they can view the playlists they have shared. In each playlist, they can add or delete songs.


## Data Model

The application will store users, playlists, and songs. 

* users can have multiple playlists (via references)
* each list can have multiple songs (by embedding)

An example user:

```javascript
{
  username: "radishsoups",
  hash: // a password hash,
  playlists: // an array of references to playlist documents
}
```

An example playlist with Embedded songs:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  name: // title of playlist
  items: [
    { name: "song1", genre: "lofi", artist: "artist1"},
    { name: "song2", genre: "classical", artist: "artist2"},
  ],
}
```

## Research Topics

* (5 points) Spotify Web API
    * I'm going to be using Spotify's API to search for songs and artists
    * This will also keep track of genres and potentially be able to search user playlists on Spotify
* (3 points) User Authentication
    * I'm going to use Passport.js for user authentication and login 
* (2 points) Hosting on Vercel
    * Connect GitHub account to Vercel in order to host the site (rather than uploading onto NYU's i6 server)
